      Have ya ever met a man with a real yardarm? Come on up and see me urchins.
      How’d you like to scrape the barnacles off of me rudder? So, tell me, why
      do they call ye, “Cap’n Feathersword?” To err is human but to arr is
      pirate!! Where there is a sea there are pirates. Right from the Voyage og
      Noah, surviving was by sailing. Avast ye! and sail against the tides.

      That’s the finest pirate booty I’ve ever laid eyes on. Not all treasure is
      silver and gold Why is the rum gone? Damnation seize my soul if I give you
      quarters, or take any from you.

      Drink up me hearties yoho …a pirates life for me Suddenly you’re like a
      pirate, you’re 65 years old and you’ve got an ear- ring. “I’ve got a jar
      of dirt! I’ve got a jar of dirt, and guess what’s inside it?” “Why is the
      rum always gone?”
